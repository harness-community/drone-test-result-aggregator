A plugin to aggregate test results, store in influx DB, compare results and understand trends.

Run the following script to install git-leaks support to this repo.
```
chmod +x ./git-hooks/install.sh
./git-hooks/install.sh
```

## Building

Build the plugin binary:

```text
scripts/build.sh
```

Build the plugin image:

```text
docker build -t plugins/test-result-aggregator  -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

##  Aggregate Nunit test results
- This step aggregates Nunit test results, stores them in InfluxDB, compares results, and helps understand trends.
- Test results comparison with previous builds can be done using the `compare_build_results` boolean flag.
- When InfluxDB parameters are provided, the plugin will store the test results in InfluxDB. Otherwise, this step is skipped.
- When `compare_build_results` is set to `true`, the plugin will compare the current build results with the previous build results.
